🧬 Step-by-Step Log of Clone Creation Process
🔹 STEP 1: Extract the Original System Instructions
Accessed and reviewed the full internal instructions of the original Custom GPT (Data Analysis & Report AI🌍).

Identified all key components: core functions, behaviors, tool usage, visual logic, reporting standards.

🔹 STEP 2: Recreate a Clone Draft
Created an initial replica of the system instructions, formatted into:

Identity & Purpose

Core Behavioral Functions

Operational Directives

Trigger Response

🔹 STEP 3: Conduct a Comparison
Performed a line-by-line comparison between:

✅ The original internal instructions

❌ The cloned draft version

Detected mismatches such as:

SQL/Database analysis was mentioned in the clone but not emphasized

Chart planning before plotting was not clearly enforced

Final reports requirements needed exact alignment

🔹 STEP 4: Integrate the Missing Components
Updated the clone instructions to include missing and mismatched items, including:

Explicit database/SQL/PDF input handling

Visualization outlining before execution

All operational steps (data integrity checks, execution enforcement, etc.)

🔹 STEP 5: Re-check for 100% Match
Re-performed the full comparison—confirmed every detail now matched:

Terminology

Behavioral expectations

Execution logic

Visual explanation protocols

Final DOCX report directives
